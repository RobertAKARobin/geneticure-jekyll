# Find the right treatment for<br>_high blood pressure._

Geneticure's Hypertension Panel analyzes the parts of your DNA that predict how your body will respond to different high blood pressure medications. Using cutting-edge medical research, our proprietary algorithm helps your doctor prescribe the best treatment based on your own unique genetic signature.

Geneticure uses your DNA to recommend blood pressure medications, summed up in a printable report. To collect a sample of your DNA, each Geneticure "test kit" contains a sterile cotton swab. [Register your kit](#) on this website, swab the inside of your cheek, and pop it in the mail. You'll be notified in 10-15 business days that your report is ready.

## For Patients & Caregivers

### Your DNA is unique. Your high blood pressure prescription should be, too.

Your genes contain information that makes you different from everyone else, but did you know that your DNA can also help determine how well your body reacts to certain types of medications? This includes high blood pressure medications.

No matter where you are in your treatment plan — whether you’ve been newly diagnosed or have been managing your blood pressure for years — with the help of your doctor, Geneticure’s test can help get you on the right path.

## For Healthcare Providers

### Proven DNA results to improve your patients' blood pressure therapy.

With a simple, non-invasive cheek-swab, Geneticure uses a proprietary algorithm to analyze 17 genotypes in 11 genes and identifies unique markers in a patient’s genetic code to determine how well their body will respond to each blood pressure medication.

The test assesses hypertension treatment in a comprehensive integrative nature, from drug metabolizing enzymes to receptors that are important to heart, blood vessel and kidney function, with a focus on and appreciation of the complexity of the disease.

## For Employers

### Increase your employees' quality of life while decreasing your healthcare costs.

High blood pressure is a leading contributor to your healthcare spending and likely affects over 1/3 of your employees. Chances are only half of them have it under control. Employees with cardiovascular disease (including high blood pressure) cost employers **an extra $1,100 per year** in lost productivity alone<sup>*</sup>, compared with healthier employees.

With Geneticure, you may be able to significantly reduce your company’s chronic disease spending by an estimated **16x ROI** or **$1409 per year per employee**.<sup>**</sup>
